# Semantic Book Recommender 📚
A personalized book recommendation system that combines semantic search and filters to suggest books based on natural language queries.

# Features:
- Natural Language Search: Users can describe the kind of book they're looking for in plain English
- Semantic Understanding: Utilizes OpenAI embeddings for intelligent book matching
- Emotional Analysis: Books are classified by emotional tone (Happy, Surprising, Angry, Suspenseful, Sad)
- Category Filtering: Filter recommendations by fiction/non-fiction categories
- Interactive UI: Clean, modern interface built with Gradio
- Large Dataset: Powered by a curated dataset of over 5,000 books with rich metadata

# Technical Stack:
- Backend: Python with LangChain for vector search
- Embeddings: OpenAI Embeddings
- Vector Store: Chroma DB
- Emotion Analysis: DistilRoBERTa for text classification
- UI Framework: Gradio
- Data Processing: Pandas & NumPy

# Data Pipeline:
1.Initial data cleaning and preprocessing
2.Fiction/Non-fiction classification using zero-shot learning
3.Emotional tone analysis using DistilRoBERTa
4.Vector embeddings generation for semantic search
5.Integration with Chroma vector store
